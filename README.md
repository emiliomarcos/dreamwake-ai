**DreamWake AI** is a web app about dreams built using React, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, and OpenAI. The main purpose of this project is to learn more about these technologies and become a better developer in general. I have always been intrigued by the world of dreams, so building an interesting project around it is a great pursuit, as well as experimenting more with AI models, prompting and tweaking them.
